# Project:65 EEPROM Programmer

This is a simple Arduino-based EEPROM Programmer designed to handle the 8KB 28c65 and the 32KB 28c256 Electronically-Erasable Programmable ROMs. Originally built as a breadboard project, it consists of:

 - An Arduino UNO, or compatible board.
 - The Arduino Ethernet shield (we only use the SD card, not the Ethernet connection).
 - 2x MCP23017 port expanders.

For a run-down of the original (28c65-only) version, see [here].
